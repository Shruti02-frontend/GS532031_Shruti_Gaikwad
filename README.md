## 🚀 Getting Started  

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project. Below are the steps to run and test the application on your local machine.  

### 🛠 Setup & Run  
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd gs-project
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```  
3. **Run the app**  
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```  
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and you should see the app running.  

### 🛠 Testing  
- Currently, there are no unit tests, but you can manually test the core functionality:
  - CRUD operations for Stores & SKUs  
  - Planning Grid calculations & conditional formatting  
  - Sidebar toggle & responsiveness  
  - Charts rendering

## 🎯 What Went Well  

I focused on delivering a **clean, structured**, and **user-friendly** UI while ensuring the core functionality works smoothly. Here’s what I’m particularly proud of:  

- **🔄 AG-Grid Customization & Data Calculations**  
  - Implemented live calculations for Sales $, GM $, and GM %.  
  - Conditional formatting makes insights pop visually.  

- **📊 Chart Integrations**  
  - Successfully integrated charts to visually represent planning data.  

- **🎨 Responsive Sidebar & Layout**  
  - Sidebar toggles seamlessly and adapts to different screen sizes.  

Each of these showcases my ability to work with **React, TypeScript, Redux, AG-Grid, and charting libraries** in a structured, scalable way.

## ⏳ What I'd Improve With More Time  

If I had **4 extra hours**, I’d focus on:  

1. **🤦 Writing Unit & Integration Tests**  
   - Adding Jest & React Testing Library for core functionality.  

2. **📈 Enhancing Performance**  
   - Optimizing AG-Grid rendering for large datasets.  
   - Implementing memoization where needed.  

3. **🎨 UI & UX Enhancements**  
   - Refining animations & transitions.  
   - Improving the sidebar’s behavior for smaller screens.  

These improvements would elevate the project in terms of maintainability, scalability, and user experience.

## 💡 Feedback & Suggestions  

The challenge was engaging and well-structured! A couple of thoughts:  
- **Clearer requirements** around edge cases (e.g., error handling scenarios) would help.  
- Maybe include some sample JSON data to test with?  

Would love to hear your feedback too! Thanks for the opportunity! 🚀
